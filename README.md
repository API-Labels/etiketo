# The Etiketo API Label Format

Welcome to the *Etiketo API Label Format*. It is a format for representing API labels and is intended to serve as an open and extensible way to represent information *about* APIs. This is an ongoing effort, and currently the following resources are availble:

* [The Etiketo API Label Format Specification](spec.md)
* [Etikedita: An Etiketo validator](https://labs.xwaay.net/labels-validator)
* [Related Work](related) (other approaches for describing APIs)
